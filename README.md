# Bamazon
Bamazon class HW


This is my customer side of the Bamazon app!
This was a little hard for me to do at first, but its getting easier over time.
The theme of this store is collectibles/valuables.
When ran, the application will present a list of inventory and prompt the user to pick an item and quantity of that item they want to buy.
Customer answer will be sent to the database and if inventory allows for the purchase it will update, else it will let the customer know.
